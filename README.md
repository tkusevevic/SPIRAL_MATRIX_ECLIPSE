# SPIRAL_MATRIX_ECLIPSE
Spiral Matrix Eclipe


This is little project about Matrix in Java (Eclipse).
First user input 2 numbers (number of row and column).
If user inputs 3 and 3 it means that the matrix size will be 3x3. 
The program fills the matrix from the lower right corner by turning the spiral. The last number is product of two entered numbers.
